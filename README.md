# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on e-commerce customer activity data.

# Problem Overview

E-commerce platforms generate vast amounts of customer interaction data. Analyzing this data to identify meaningful customer segments can help businesses better understand user preferences and optimize their sales strategies.

# Objective

The goal of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning, specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm, to group customers with similar interests based on their search and purchase behavior.

# Dataset Information

The dataset was collected from a well-known e-commerce website over a period of time and contains customer search profiles, order history, and brand interaction details.

# Methodology

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Determining optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score)

Applying K-Means clustering

Visualizing and interpreting customer segments
